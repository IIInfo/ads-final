We conducted user interviews with each of our hypothesized persona types (consumers, doctors, FDA administrators, senior citizens, advocacy groups) which were updated, expanded or removed based on the incoming user data. For instance, we originally had a doctor persona which was removed after several phone interviews with doctors because user data showed that they were not, in reality, a target audience. Based on our in-person user interviews in a LabCorp waiting room, our consumer persona was broken into two very different personas (Becca the label reader; Vic a non-reader). We conducted two rounds of usability testing (4-5 participants in each round) on wireframes created in Axure with both Beccas and Vics. These were moderated, in-person usability test sessions where the participants pulled up our wireframes and walked through unstructured impressions on layout, navigation, content and interaction. We made significant changes based on both preference and behavioral data from each round of this small-scale usability testing.
