- Style Guide

- Wireframes

- Mockups

We began the design process by selecting a bootstrap theme that provided a close resemblance to our vision for the prototype. We chose this approach to help with familiarizing the team with the direction for the styling and components that we would ultimately design around. As our wireframes matured, we used these components as a foundation and customized the styling to reflect our vision.

We developed a design style guide to provide the team with a general reference point for our core design specifications. This includes:

* Screen Samples
* Header, Footer and Navigation Patterns
* Logo Treatment
* Colors and Hex Values
* Typography
* Buttons and Controls
* Graphs
* Imagery
* Iconography

In addition to the design style guide, wireframes and a set of High Fidelity mockups were provided to provide the complete design vision for the prototype.
