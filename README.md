Label Craft is a crowd-sourcing platform for cataloging the adverse reactions found on drug labels in order to determine whether manufacturers have accurately reported the adverse reactions compared to what is reported by end users.  Data from the platform is searchable on the site by drug and also is accessible via API for integration with other applications.   The platform provides the foundation for additional improvements in FDA data quality required to gain the most value from the data.

Our approach on this challenge and the resulting outputs showcase the value that Booz Allen brings to the 18F BPA including the following:

*	Time-tested Agile Delivery Process – Our firm’s extensive experience in successfully performing Agile Delivery for small and large IT programs results [reliable and proficient application of Agile practices].
*	A Culture of Innovation - We applied our SIG (Culture of Innovation, Importance for the business raised to enterprise level w/u the company, growth platform going forward, bleeding edge of stuff.).
*	Experienced Staff – Booz Allen was able to quickly assemble a high-skilled, cross-functional team in order to support the challenge.  We were able to tap a set of domain experts at the firm with multiple years of experience in FDA and even the FDA data set.   We focus on (Domain Expertise, Hot Skills / Bench, Building Skills) …

## Understanding:

### RFQ –
We understand 18f’s goal for the Agile BPA to procure digital services and agile methodologies through our ability to provide the appropriate resources to the execution of a sample prototype.

Our prototype is a demonstration of our process and capabilities.

### Digital Services Playbook
We believe in the US Digital Services playbook as an effective set of guidelines for delivery of digital programs.  The playbook includes a set of checklists and questions that should be answered during the execution of a program..  Our responses to the checklist are contained in the artifact linked below:

### 18F
We understand the 18F five key principles guide.

1.	Put the needs of users first
2.	Release early, iteratively, and often 
3.	Don’t slow down delivery
4.	Only do it if it adds value
5.	Work in the open

A description of how understanding of 18F tenets is contained in the following artifact:

{Some example Text: We applied a user-centric approach to our Agile process starting with visioning session, selecting a concept, and building personas.   We released often, using continuous builds/deployment with multiple releases to production following GitFlow.   We moved quickly, pivoting when needed and eradicating blockers rapidly.  We analyzed the value of each decision, and consulted the product owner the deficiencies in the FDA data and problems that come from that. All code developed in GitHub.}
H2 – Section 3 - Approach:
H3 - Agile Process
The Agile Process we applied for this challenge was tailored for the five day process.   Our applied Scrum in the form of 4-hour sprints with daily releases.

•	HCI – 
•	Agile / Lean - 
•	Dev Ops –
